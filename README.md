# Paying For College: Analyzing how Students Finance their Education
## Stat 456 (Projects in Data Science) - Nolan Meyer & Anton Korolev

**Abstract:**
With tuition costs continuing to rise and being current college students, we were interested in exploring questions around financing college and the economic benefits of earning certain degrees - questions we had to ask ourselves in our own college journey. 
In this project we analyzed a few main research questions:

- On average, who can afford to pay more (based on EFC), and who borrows more money to pay for their undergraduate studies? 
- Are there any differences in borrowing between these groups, for those with similar EFC's (Expected Family Contribution)? Is one group borrowing more/less than the other?
- What major(s) provide the greatest increase in finacial well-being after college?

Our two groups of interest that we analyzed included gender (m/f) and field of study.
